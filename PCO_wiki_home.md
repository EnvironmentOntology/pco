The PCO currently imports the BFO and uses BFO terms for root nodes (e.g. PCO:population process is a subclass of BFO:process). Other terms will be imported from IAO, CARO, PATO, and GO.

Of particular interest is how to deal with [BiologicalProcesses](BiologicalProcesses.md) and [Qualities](Qualities.md) for populations and communities, which may fall within the domain or GO or PATO, respectively.

See the [Interactions\_with\_other\_ontologies](Interactions_with_other_ontologies.md) for more details.
